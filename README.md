# MSIT-modelling
R scripts for MSIT modelling using PMWG

The multi-source interference task (MSIT) model setup and description can be found in the accompanying paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811923001349).

The Bayesian Hierarchical model is implemented using the Particle-Metropolis within Gibbs (PMwG) package in R.
